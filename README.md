# [Project 1: Red Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/TianShuFan/Red_Wine_Classification)
* Developed multiple models using various classification techniques to predict red wine quality based on intrinsic chemical properties. 
* Optimized Support Vector, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM Classifiers using GridSearchCV to reach best performance. 
* Achieved 90% accuracy along with a roc-auc score of 0.785 via tuned LightGBM Classifier. (Note: dataset is imbalanced)

# [Project 2: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/TianShuFan/Car_Price_Predictions)
* Performed extended data cleaning via feature selection, outlier control, missing values imputation, and categorical variables encoding. 
* Developed multiple models using various regression techniques to predict used car sales price based on past sales.
* Optimized Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM Regressors using RandomizedSearchCV along with fine tuning to reach improved performance. 
* Achieved MAE of 2262 via tuned Random Forest Regressor. 
* The dataset is provided by Kaggle through a web scraper compiling US craigslist vehicle entries.
